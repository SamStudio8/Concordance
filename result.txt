349:  For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,
354:  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
781:  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
866:  To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury.
1701:    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
1705:  Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
2176:  But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
2286:  As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
2588:  Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
2589:  Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,
2640:  Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
2647:  'I hate' she altered with an end,
2651:    'I hate', from hate away she threw,
2719:    But love hate on for now I know thy mind,
2733:  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
2761:  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
3402:    Let not your hate encounter with my love,
4080:    Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
5404:    That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
5732:    While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.
5791:    And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,
6462:    In time we hate that which we often fear.
7389:    I cannot hate thee worser than I do
9169:    As if a god in hate of mankind had
10792:    By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his
10793:    father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.
10794:  ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
11652:    wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
12283:    I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
12284:    I have more cause to hate him than to love him;
15619:    Deserves your hate; and your affections are
15625:    And call him noble that was now your hate,
16055:    There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
16226:  MARCIUS. I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
16228:  AUFIDIUS. We hate alike:
16266:    That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,
16406:    My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it
16743:    love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground.
16745:    hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
16750:    but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
17184:    And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
17190:    After the inveterate hate he bears you.
18320:    My birthplace hate I, and my love's upon
18449:    Since I have ever followed thee with hate,
18583:  FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
18754:    As those should do that had deserv'd his hate,
19039:  FIRST WATCH. Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when
20884:    To accuse myself I hate you; which I had rather
21191:    In a true hate to pray they have their will:
21848:  CLOTEN. I love and hate her; for she's fair and royal,
21856:    I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
25063:    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
29274:    When a jest is so forward- and afoot too- I hate it.
29314:    whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they hate us youth. Down
33953:    Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
34940:    Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.
40307:    As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
44067:    And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
44655:    With full as many signs of deadly hate,
45251:  KING HENRY. Lord Say, the traitors hate thee;
46759:    Alas, poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
48255:  QUEEN MARGARET. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
49181:    Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate.
50688:    Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,
52134:    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
52226:    Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee;
52958:    This is of purpose laid by some that hate me-
54391:    That I can find should merit any hate.
55018:    Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
58793:    When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
59825:     Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,
59833:     To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
61742:     That it doth hate what gets it.
62123:     But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
63326:     Did hate thee, or thy father!
65928:    So much I hate a breaking cause to be
66812:    Your favors nor your hate.
69063:    Some say he's mad; others, that lesser hate him,
73040:    I hate him for he is a Christian;
73571:    But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
74134:    Hate counsels not in such a quality.
74785:    More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing
74793:  BASSANIO. Every offence is not a hate at first.
79046:  HERMIA. The more I hate, the more he follows me.
80079:    Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
80084:    When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
80124:    The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?
80209:    Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
80210:  HERMIA. What! Can you do me greater harm than hate?
80211:    Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love?
80221:    That I do hate thee and love Helena.
80615:    To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
83149:    Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
83578:    hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man's
84106:  RODERIGO. Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
84266:    Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,
84837:    and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is
84853:    But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,
86286:    To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
87861:    For nought did I in hate, but all in honor.
88065:    And free from other misbegotten hate,
88146:    How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
88237:    The swelling difference of your settled hate;
88475:    And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
88535:    This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
89012:    Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us an,
89218:    Is near the hate of those love not the King.
89221:    By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
89685:    Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.
89757:    By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
90604:    That fear to hate; and hate turns one or both
91186:    I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
91330:    And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
91334:    In deadly hate the one against the other;
91743:    To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
91815:    I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
92128:    Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
92446:  CLARENCE. If you do love my brother, hate not me;
92479:    To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
92549:  RIVERS. By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate;
92579:    With hate in those where I expect most love!
92600:    Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
92611:    I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
93371:    That they which brought me in my master's hate,
93569:    Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;
94791:      hate thee,
95481:    O, no! Alas, I rather hate myself
95930:  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
95931:    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
95968:    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
96055:    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
96056:    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
96656:  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
97672:    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
97983:    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
98232:    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
98260:    Proud can I never be of what I hate,
98261:    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
99371:    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
103203:    Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
104094:    One spirit to command; they all do hate him
104353:    To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
104356:    That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,
105461:  APEMANTUS. E'en as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my heart.
106667:    It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
106862:    And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
106999:  TIMON. I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
107146:    Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
107199:  TIMON. I hate thee worse.
107239:    Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
107280:  TIMON. On what I hate I feed not.
107281:  APEMANTUS. Dost hate a medlar?
107509:    Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
107950:    Here lie I, Timon, who alive all living men did hate.
110337:    Which signifies what hate they bear their Emperor
112479:  AJAX. I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend'ring of toads.
114436:    So much by weight hate I her Diomed.
115779:  SIR TOBY. A false conclusion! I hate it as an unfill'd can. To be
116540:    hate; I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
117011:    I hate ingratitude more in a man
117557:  SIR TOBY. Then he's a rogue and a passy measures pavin. I hate a
118060:  LUCETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
119058:    For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
119111:    If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
119434:    Three things that women highly hold in hate.
119435:  DUKE. Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
119466:    To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
120142:    Than hate of Eglamour, that goes with her.              Exit
120144:    Than hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.            Exit
120842:    I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee;
